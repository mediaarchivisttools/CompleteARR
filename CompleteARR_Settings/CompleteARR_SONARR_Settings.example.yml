# Sets: map relationships between INCOMPLETE and COMPLETE quality profiles / root folders.
# You have have as many sets as you like, the config below is just what I use.
#
# Each set describes a "media type", AKA set name. This is only used for logging. Your Plex/Jellyfin/Emby users wont see your sets.
# - The "Incomplete" profile/root is where shows go if they have missing episodes.
# - Once all non-special episodes are downloaded, the show is promoted to the corresponding "Complete" quality profile / root folder.
# - Your Plex/Jellyfin/Emby library should only point to the COMPLETE root folders for each media type.
# - If missing episodes appear and are older than GraceDays, the show is demoted to the "Incomplete" quality profile / root folder. and the cycle starts again.
#
# Run Fetchinfo.ps1 to get your Quality Profile names and Root Paths
# Uncomment the Sets section below and edit to match your FetchInfo results.
